The following notes describe changes that were made to the data set to
configure it for use with the StateMod GUI.  In the future, these changes can
be included in the basic data set prior to placement on the CDSS web site.

1) Downloaded the 1/18/2010 model from the CDSS website on 2010-12-19.
Installed the files to C:\CDSS\data\cm2009.  Also downloaded the documentation
for the model (data set) and saved in the DocSW folder as per StateMod
conventions.

2) Created this file in DocSW.

3) The basic data set as downloaded does not include GIS files needed by the
   GUI so put those together.  One approach is to put all CDSS GIS files in
   a generic location like C:\CDSS\GIS\Div1\*.shp, etc.  Another approach is
   to put all GIS files needed for a data in a GIS folder parallel to other
   model data folders.  The latter approach was taken here because a
   self-contained StateMod data set is being distributed with the StateMod GUI.
   Therefore, download GIS layers from http://cdss.state.co.us (go to GIS
   products).  The layers are configured using a cm2009.gvp file
   (GeoView Project - text map file description for StateMod GUI)
   configuration file in the main statemod folder.

* download data from CDSS website
* configure the sm2009.gvp file
* based on the StateMod GUI files created to indicate missing spatial data
  (e.g., "x-gui-MissingSpatial-dds.csv", create CSV files to fill in some of
  the missing values:

  ../GIS/mf.csv - for instream flows
  ../GIS/plans.csv - for plans

4) Updated the cm2009.rsp file as follows:

* Removed blanks from the end of some lines - line wrapping was ugly.
* Added an entry for "Network" in the response file, to indicate the *.net file.
* Added an entry for "GeographicInformation" in the response file,
  to indicate the *.gvp file.
* Added an entry for "StateModExecutable" in the response file, to indicate
  the executable that should be run by the GUI.

5) Updated all the other *.rsp files similar to above.

6) Add "FileFormatVersion 2" comment to cm2009C.opr and cm2009H.opr - the GUI
   works on the new format.

==============================================================================

Questions/comments about this dataset:

1) Why do structures use 6-character WDIDs?  They should be updated
   to 7-character WDIDs.  The network can be manually edited if necessary to
   make this switch or a tool could be developed to do it.
2) Need to do more work in the StateMod GUI to display irrigated lands.
3) Map layers need standard symbols for consistency across all data sets.
4) If there is time, will implement a CSV map layer format for aggregate
   structures and other data not in the shapefiles.  This will round out the
   map interface.  Note that in the big picture, adding coordinates to station
   files could be another approach, and including lat/long is needed (can project
   on the fly or also provide X/Y in data files).
5) Why does the cm2009H.opr file say "examples" at the top?

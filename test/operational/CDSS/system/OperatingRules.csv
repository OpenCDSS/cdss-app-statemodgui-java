# Operating Rule (also called Operational Right) Summary
#
# The main purpose of this file is to tell the StateMod graphical user interface
# (GUI) which operating rules should be treated as text because the GUI is
# not completely handling the rule.  This is needed because advances in the
# StateMod model may be ahead of the GUI or because additional software development
# and testing is needed.  The GUI does have internal defaults for which rights are
# supported for detailed editing; however, turning a right type off in this file
# will override the GUI default.  Later updates to the GUI may provide more support
# for operational rights.
#
# If an operating rule is turned off (no below), it will be displayed and be
# editable in text form.  If an operating rule is on (yes below), it will be editable
# using a form.
#
# This list was extracted from the OperatingRules.xls spreadsheet.
#
# Specify yes or no for the EditingSupported column
#    - only "no" will change the default
